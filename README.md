## Overview

This application aims to bridge the gap between web2 and web3, by using the familiar interaction of web2, and the decentralised nature of web3 to be able to seamlessly transfer data from one point to another.

This application aims to bridge that gap by by providing a unique DWN to each user, which is then the user's decentralised ID for communication through out all websites which support the web5 characteristics.

## The Challenge

The core thing faced in this was seamlessly linking the application to be able to interact will all applications in the web5 chain, by ensuring that data stored could be shared seamlessly between platforms which could use said data.

## The Process

It involved us linking the backend with the DWN provider, and createing an API from it which we would use to then link throughout the application.
